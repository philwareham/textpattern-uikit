h2. Setup

h3. Installing required tools

The project uses "Grunt":http://gruntjs.com/ to run tasks and "Sass":http://sass-lang.com/ for CSS pre-processing. This creates few dependencies in addition to your normal PHP required by Textpattern. First make sure you have base dependencies installed: "Node.js":http://nodejs.org/ and "Grunt":http://gruntjs.com/. You can install Node using the "installer":https://nodejs.org and Grunt with npm:

bc. $ npm install -g grunt-cli

Consult the Grunt documentation for more instructions if necessary. You might need to use @sudo npm install -g grunt-cli@ instead when installing on certain Unix-based systems.

h3. Installing dependencies

After you have the base dependencies taken care of, you can install the project's dependencies. Navigate to the project's directory, and run the dependency managers:

bc. $ cd textpattern-uikit
$ npm install

*npm* installs Node modules for Grunt. You might need to use @sudo npm install@ instead when installing on certain Unix-based systems. The project will also require the normal git, Apache, MySQL and PHP in order to run Textpattern. All requirements must be added to your path variable.

h2. Building

h2. Updating UIkit
