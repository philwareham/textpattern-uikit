* "Grunt":http://gruntjs.com/ ~0.4.0
* "Bower":http://bower.io/ >=1.0.0

h2. Setup

h3. Installing required tools

The project uses "Grunt":http://gruntjs.com/ to run tasks and "Sass":http://sass-lang.com/ for CSS pre-processing. First make sure you have base dependencies installed: "Node.js":http://nodejs.org/, "Grunt":http://gruntjs.com/ and "Bower":http://bower.io/. You can install Node using the "installer":https://nodejs.org and the rest with npm:

bc. $ npm install -g bower grunt-cli

Consult the tools' documentation for more instructions. You might need to use @sudo npm install -g bower grunt-cli@ instead when installing on certain Unix-based systems.

h3. Installing dependencies

After you have the base dependencies taken care of, you can install the project's dependencies. Navigate to the project's directory, and run the dependency managers:

bc. $ cd textpattern-uikit
$ npm install
$ bower install

*npm* installs Node modules for Grunt and *bower* manages client-side scripts. You might need to use @sudo npm install@ instead when installing on certain Unix-based systems. The project will also require the normal git, Apache, MySQL and PHP in order to run Textpattern. All requirements must be added to your path variable.
